# Overview

A salesperson at a large tech firm is faced with a new payment
structure.

This salesperson has a quarterly sales quota $Q$ of $\$225,000$.

The commission received $C$ follows a progressive schedule with four
brackets as follows:

-   **Bracket 1**. For the first $40\%$ of $Q$, the salesperson receives
    $7\%$ on $Q$ reached.
-   **Bracket 2**. For the next $30\%$ of $Q$, the salesperson receives
    $10\%$ on $Q$ reached.
-   **Bracket 3**. For the next $20\%$ of $Q$, the salesperson receives
    $13\%$ on $Q$ reached.
-   **Bracket 4**. For the final $10\%$ of $Q$, the salesperson receives
    $16\%$ on $Q$ reached.

As an example of how to apply this schedule, consider the case of a
salesperson who brings in $50\%$ of $Q$, or $\$112,500$ of sales.\
In this situation, the sales land in the second bracket. So we can
compute $C$ as follows:

-   $a$ = the first $40\%$ paid out at $7\%$, or
    $\$225,000 \times 40\% \times 7\% = \$6,300$.
-   $b$ = the next $10\%$ paid out at $10\%$, or
    $\$225,000 \times 10\% \times 10\% = \$2,250$.

The total payout $C$ to the salesperson would be $a + b = \$8,550$.

Notice that getting to the second bracket does *not* mean the payout is
$\$225,000 \times 50\% \times 10\%$.

In another example, a salesperson is at $20\%$ quota. Their payout would
be $\$225,000 \times 20\% \times 7\%$.

This schedule represents earnings up to $100\%$ of quota. We ignore
sales above $100\%$ here.

Given the above, the salesperson would like to know how much she would
earn if she reaches a given percentage of quarterly quota.

# Task 1

(2 points)

Assign the value of $Q$ to `quota`.

Create a data frame called `df` that encodes the information presented
in the question.

That is, assume that each row of the data frame stands for a bracket,
and that the columns stand for the features described in the progressive
schedule.

Initially, the data frame should have two columns:

-   `cut` for the percentage value associated with the bracket, i.e.
    $.4, .3, ...$
-   `payout_pct` for the percent of $Q$ received for the bracket, i.e.
    $.07, .1, ...$

In both cases, express the percentages as a decimal value between $0$
and $1$.

Display `df` in a cell.

```{r}
quota <- 225000
df <- data.frame(
  cut = c(0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1),
  payout_pct = c(0.07, 0.10, 0.13, 0.16)
)

print(df)
```

# Task 2

(2 points)

Augment `df` with derived columns that will be used to compute $C$ for a
given amount of sales:

-   `cut_sum`: The cumulative sum of `cut`, e.g. $.4$, $.7, ...$
-   `amt`: The earned quota, i.e. product of `cut` and $Q$.
-   `payout`: The product of `amt` and `payout_cut`.
-   `payout_sum`: The cumulative sum of `payout`.
-   `amt_sum`: The cumulative sum of the earned quota `amt`.

Display the augmented `df` in a cell.

```{r}
df$cut_sum <- cumsum(df$cut)
df$amt <- df$cut * quota
df$payout <- df$amt * df$payout_pct
df$payout_sum <- cumsum(df$payout)
df$amt_sum <- cumsum(df$amt)

print(df)

```

# Task 3

(2 points)

Write a function `get_bracket()` that will return the bracket number
$k \in [1,2,3,4]$ for a given amount of sales $S$, represented as a
fraction of $Q$ expressed as a decimal number rounded to one place.

For example, if a salesperson makes $50\%$ of quota, then $S = .5$.

The function should use `df` and assume it is global.

Hints:

This function requires that you match $S$ to a value in the appropriate
column of `df`. To do this, you'll need to use a boolean condition
comparing $S$ to the column, and then select the index of the column
that meets the condition. You can select the index using `which()`.

However, sometimes `which()` will return a vector with more than one
value, so you will need to select either the `min()` or `max()` of the
returned vector, depending on the condition.

Finally, to make sure that borderline values, such as $.4$, are matched
with the correct bracket (e.g. $.4$ belongs to bracket 1 not 2), you
should round both values in the boolean expression using `round()`.

```{r}
get_bracket <- function(S) {
  bracket <- which(round(S, 1) <= round(df$cut_sum, 1))[1]
  return(bracket)
}

#Test Cases
print(get_bracket(0.5))
print(get_bracket(0.2))

```

# Task 4

(4 points)

Write a function that takes an argument for the fraction of quarterly
quota $S$ reached by the salesperson and returns the dollar amount
earned $C$.

This function must use `df` and `get_bracket()` as globals.

Do not use for loops in completing this task or the next. Instead, let
your data frame do the work. In your function, match the amount earned
to the appropriate row in your first data frame to get the information
needed to computer the answer.

Hints:

You can compute the result using only the data for the row associated
with the bracket.

Try to emulate the formula in the instructions, where $C = a + b$, and
$a$ is the commission earned from the lower brackets and $b$ is the
commission earned on the quota $Q$ reached in the current bracket.

The value of $a$ can be computed by subtracting the payout for the
bracket from the cumulative sum of the payout.

There are various ways to compute the value of $b$. One way is to figure
out how much of the earnings apply to the current bracket and then
multiply that by the payout percentage. Another is to emulate the
example â€” compute the percentage of $S$ that applies to the bracket and
multiply this by $Q$ and the payout percentage.

Note, finally, that you may not need all of the columns in `df` to compute
$C$.

Test your function by passing it a value of $.5$ and make sure it
returns a value of $8550$.

```{r}
compute_commission <- function(S) {
  bracket <- get_bracket(S)
  
  #a = sum of previous brackets' earnings
  a <- ifelse(bracket > 1, df$payout_sum[bracket - 1], 0)
  
  #Computing b (commission in current bracket)
  prev_cut <- ifelse(bracket > 1, df$cut_sum[bracket - 1], 0)
  current_amt <- (S - prev_cut) * quota
  b <- current_amt * df$payout_pct[bracket]
  
  #Total commission
  C <- a + b
  return(C)
}

print(compute_commission(0.5))

```

# Task 5

(2 points)

Call the function to get the dollar amount earned in increments of
$10\%$ in a range between $10\%$ to $100\%$ earned. Note that you can
use `seq()` to generate these increments.

Put the results of your function in a second data frame called `df2`
with columns for percent of quota earned $S$ and commission $C$ for that
amount.

Display `df2` in a cell.

The result should look like this:

```         
     S     C
1  0.1  1575
2  0.2  3150
3  0.3  4725
4  0.4  6300
5  0.5  8550
6  0.6 10800
7  0.7 13050
8  0.8 15975
9  0.9 18900
10 1.0 22500
```

```{r}
S_values <- seq(0.1, 1.0, by = 0.1)
C_values <- sapply(S_values, compute_commission)
df2 <- data.frame(S = S_values, C = C_values)

print(df2)

```
